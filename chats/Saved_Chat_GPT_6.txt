Sure, here's a Python code to extract up to 5 terms from the given text:

python
Copy code
import re

text = "The term 'climate change' is a synonym of the term 'climate change mitigation'.\n\nThe term 'climate change mitigation' is a synonym of the term 'climate change mitigation policy'.\n\nThe term 'climate change mitigation policy' is a synonym of the term 'climate change mitigation'.\n\nThe term 'climate change mitigation' is a synonym of the term 'climate change mitigation policy'.\n\nThe term 'climate change mitigation policy' is a synonym of the term 'climate change mitigation'.\n\nThe term 'climate change mitigation' is a synonym of the term 'climate change mitigation policy'.\n\nThe term 'climate change mitigation policy' is a synonym of the term 'climate change mitigation'."

# use regex to find all the terms
terms = re.findall(r"'(.*?)'", text)

# remove duplicate terms
terms = list(set(terms))

# print up to 5 terms
print(terms[:5])


This code uses regular expressions to find all the terms in the text enclosed in single quotes. It then removes any duplicate terms and finally prints up to the first 5 unique terms found.
