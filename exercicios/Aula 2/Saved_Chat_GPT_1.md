give me a python code that extract docs from msmarco collection.tsv, preprocess, remove stopwords and create a bow
--------------------------
Sure, here's an example Python code that does what you've described using the NLTK library:

python
Copy code
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from collections import Counter

### Download the stopwords list if it hasn't been downloaded already
nltk.download('stopwords')

### Define the path to the MSMARCO collection file
collection_file_path = 'path/to/msmarco/collection.tsv'

### Define a function to preprocess a text string
def preprocess(text):
    ### Convert the text to lowercase
    text = text.lower()
    ### Tokenize the text into individual words
    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
    ### Remove stopwords from the text
    stopwords_list = stopwords.words('english')
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in stopwords_list]
    ### Return the preprocessed text as a list of tokens
    return tokens

### Open the MSMARCO collection file for reading
with open(collection_file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as collection_file:
    ### Initialize a Counter object to keep track of word frequencies
    word_counts = Counter()
    ### Loop over each line in the file
    for line in collection_file:
        ### Split the line into document ID and text
        doc_id, text = line.strip().split('\t')
        ### Preprocess the text
        tokens = preprocess(text)
        ### Update the word counts with the preprocessed tokens
        word_counts.update(tokens)

### Print the most common 10 words in the collection
print(word_counts.most_common(10))


This code reads in the MSMARCO collection file, preprocesses each document's text by converting to lowercase, tokenizing, and removing stopwords, and then creates a bag-of-words representation of the collection using a Counter object. The resulting bag-of-words is a dictionary where each key is a word in the collection and each value is the frequency of that word in the collection.



generate a inverted index from this bow
--------------------------
Certainly! Here's an example Python code that generates an inverted index from the bag-of-words created in the previous example:

python
Copy code
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from collections import Counter

### Download the stopwords list if it hasn't been downloaded already
nltk.download('stopwords')

### Define the path to the MSMARCO collection file
collection_file_path = 'path/to/msmarco/collection.tsv'

### Define a function to preprocess a text string
def preprocess(text):
    ### Convert the text to lowercase
    text = text.lower()
    ### Tokenize the text into individual words
    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
    ### Remove stopwords from the text
    stopwords_list = stopwords.words('english')
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in stopwords_list]
    ### Return the preprocessed text as a list of tokens
    return tokens

### Define a dictionary to store the inverted index
inverted_index = {}

### Open the MSMARCO collection file for reading
with open(collection_file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as collection_file:
    ### Loop over each line in the file
    for line in collection_file:
        ### Split the line into document ID and text
        doc_id, text = line.strip().split('\t')
        ### Preprocess the text
        tokens = preprocess(text)
        ### Create a bag-of-words for the preprocessed text
        word_counts = Counter(tokens)
        ### Loop over each word in the bag-of-words
        for word, count in word_counts.items():
            ### Add the document ID to the inverted index for this word
            if word not in inverted_index:
                inverted_index[word] = set()
            inverted_index[word].add(doc_id)

### Print the inverted index
print(inverted_index)


This code uses the bag-of-words created in the previous example to construct an inverted index, which is a dictionary where each key is a word in the collection and each value is a set of document IDs that contain that word. The code loops over each document in the collection, preprocesses its text, and creates a bag-of-words for the preprocessed text. It then loops over each word in the bag-of-words and adds the document ID to the inverted index for that word.

Note that the inverted index is stored as a dictionary of sets, where each set contains the document IDs that contain the corresponding word. This allows for fast document retrieval based on a query term.



give me a python code that parse the msmarco query file queries.train.tsv, preprocess the queries just like the function above and retrieve document ids from inverted index above.
--------------------------
Sure, here's an example Python code that parses the MSMARCO query file queries.train.tsv, preprocesses the queries using the preprocess function from the previous example, and retrieves document IDs from the inverted index generated in the previous example:

python
Copy code
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

### Download the stopwords list if it hasn't been downloaded already
nltk.download('stopwords')

### Define the path to the MSMARCO query file
query_file_path = 'path/to/msmarco/queries.train.tsv'

### Define the path to the MSMARCO collection file
collection_file_path = 'path/to/msmarco/collection.tsv'

### Define a function to preprocess a text string
def preprocess(text):
    ### Convert the text to lowercase
    text = text.lower()
    ### Tokenize the text into individual words
    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
    ### Remove stopwords from the text
    stopwords_list = stopwords.words('english')
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in stopwords_list]
    ### Return the preprocessed text as a list of tokens
    return tokens

### Define a dictionary to store the inverted index
inverted_index = {}

### Open the MSMARCO collection file for reading
with open(collection_file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as collection_file:
    ### Loop over each line in the file
    for line in collection_file:
        ### Split the line into document ID and text
        doc_id, text = line.strip().split('\t')
        ### Preprocess the text
        tokens = preprocess(text)
        ### Create a bag-of-words for the preprocessed text
        word_counts = Counter(tokens)
        ### Loop over each word in the bag-of-words
        for word, count in word_counts.items():
            ### Add the document ID to the inverted index for this word
            if word not in inverted_index:
                inverted_index[word] = set()
            inverted_index[word].add(doc_id)

### Open the MSMARCO query file for reading
with open(query_file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as query_file:
    ### Loop over each line in the file
    for line in query_file:
        ### Split the line into query ID and text
        query_id, text = line.strip().split('\t')
        ### Preprocess the query text
        query_tokens = preprocess(text)
        ### Initialize a set to store the document IDs that contain all query terms
        matching_docs = set()
        ### Loop over each query term and retrieve the corresponding document IDs from the inverted index
        for query_term in query_tokens:
            if query_term in inverted_index:
                matching_docs = matching_docs.union(inverted_index[query_term])
        ### Print the query ID and the matching document IDs
        print(f'{query_id}\t{" ".join(matching_docs)}')


This code reads in the MSMARCO collection file and generates an inverted index, just like in the previous example. It then reads in the MSMARCO query file queries.train.tsv, preprocesses each query using the preprocess function, and retrieves the document IDs that contain all query terms from the inverted index. The resulting document IDs are printed to standard output, along with the corresponding query ID. Note that the document IDs are separated by spaces.



now evaluate these results using TREC-DL 2020 file qrels.train.tsv and nDCG@10 metric
--------------------------
Sure, here's an example Python code that evaluates the results from the previous example using the TREC-DL 2020 file qrels.train.tsv and the nDCG@10 metric:

        doc_id, text = line.strip().split('\t')
        ### Preprocess the text
        tokens = preprocess(text)
        ### Create a bag-of-words for the preprocessed text
        word_counts = Counter(tokens)
        ### Loop over each word in the bag-of-words
        for word, count in word_counts.items():
            ### Add the document ID to the inverted index for this word

                inverted_index[word] = set()
            inverted_index[word].add(doc_id)

        ### Split the line into query ID, document ID, and relevance judgment
        query_id, _, doc_id, relevance = line.strip().split('\t')
        ### Convert the relevance judgment to an integer
        relevance = int(relevance)
        ### Add the relevance judgment to the dictionary
        if query_id not in relevance_judgments:
            relevance_judgments[query_id] = {}
        relevance_judgments[query_id][doc_id] = relevance

### Define a function to compute the nDCG@k for a query and a set of document IDs

    if num_relevant_docs == 0:
        return 0.0
    ### Compute the ideal ranking of documents for the query
    ideal_ranking = sorted(relevant_docs.items(),
